        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  	  	<p>Version 1.2. Last Revised: 1/2/2014</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is provided by United BioSource Corporation (“UBC”, “we”, “us” or “our”) to all visitors (“you” or “your”) who use the available pages of the UBC.com website located at <a href="http://www.UBC.com/">http://www.UBC.com/</a> (the “Site”). This Site is provided to you as a service to share information with the pharmaceutical and biotech industry.</p>
        <p>We are firmly committed to protecting the confidentiality of your Personal Information. The term “Personal Information” means any information which can be used to identify you including by way of example, but not limitation, name, date of birth, mailing address, phone number, cell phone number, and/or e-mail address.</p>
        <p>Certain portions of the Site may have additional terms and conditions that require your further affirmative assent (the “Additional Terms”). To the extent any terms in this Privacy Policy conflict with any terms contained within the Additional Terms, the conflicting terms in the Additional Terms will control and override the corresponding terms in this Privacy Policy. The “UBC Protection of Personal Data SOP” is also made available to you through the Site (the “SOP”). To the extent any terms in this Privacy Policy or the Additional Terms that conflict with any terms contained within the SOP, the conflicting terms in the SOP will control and override the corresponding terms in this Privacy Policy or the Additional Terms.</p>
        <h4>COLLECTION AND USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
        <h4>How We Collect Non-Personal Information</h4>
        <h4>General Tracking Information</h4>
        <p>When you visit the Site, we may collect Non-Personal Information from you.  "Non-Personal Information" means a data element or collection of data elements that by itself cannot be associated with a specific individual.  Non-Personal Information includes by way of example but not limitation, the Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, your IP address or the automatic tracking of the pages of this Site that you access, and Site data collected on an aggregated, anonymous basis through web server logs and cookie technology (further described below), third-party ad servers, clear GIFs, and/or web beacons.  Our web server automatically collects this information, including your IP address, when you request pages from our server.  We may also collect other information regarding your interactions with the Site.</p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>We may utilize a standard technology called “cookies” and web server logs to collect information about how our Site is used.  A cookie is a very small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier.  Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, the time spent at our Site, and the websites visited immediately prior to and after visiting our Site.  When you visit the Site, the Site’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies.  Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it.  With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  Please refer to your browser's instructions or online help files to learn more about these functions.</p>
        <h4>Wehn We Use Non-Personal Information</h4>
        <p>We may use two kinds of cookies – session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Session ID cookies are used to personalize your user experience, to determine ways to improve our Site, Site content, and the services offered through the Site.  These cookies are deleted from your hard drive when you close your browser session.  Persistent cookies are used to collect non-personally identifiable information such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp and number of clicks.</p>
        <p>We use your IP address so that we can send data (such as the web pages you request) to you.  We aggregate this data with data on the pages visited by other users to track overall visitor traffic patterns to help us understand how you use the Site and your preferred and most frequently used Site pages and services, to provide you with better service connections and improved Site use and functionality, and to provide you with information on other services and offers that may be of interest to you.  We may analyze utilization information in the aggregate to study outcomes, costs, and provider profiles, and to suggest benefit designs for employers or health plans.  These studies generate Aggregate Data (described below) which we may utilize, sell, or disclose to other companies or organizations.  We will not sell your Non-Personal Information to other companies or organizations.</p>
        <p>We may perform statistical analyses of the traffic patterns, Site usage, and behaviors associated with our Site.  We may use these analyses to generate Aggregate Data from the original Non-Personal Information.  “Aggregate Data” is summary level data, such as the number of web visitors in a specific geographic area.  Aggregate Data does not contain information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address, and does not reflect the original form of the Non-Personal Information collected from you.  We may sell or disclose the Aggregate Data to other companies or organizations.  In some cases, we may share Non-Personal Information with third parties who provide services to us.</p>
        <h4>Third-Party Usage</h4>
        <p>We may use third parties to (a) operate and maintain the server(s) on which the Site operates, (b) provide cookies, ad servers, clear GIFs, and web beacons that we embed in our Site, and (c) collect Non-Personal Information on your interactions with the Site.  The third party will then share the Non-Personal Information, Aggregate Data, and/or other data with us.</p>
        <h4>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
        <h4>Correspondence</h4>
        <p>When available, you may sign up for an informational newsletter and/or site updates from UBC by providing your Personal Information through the Site.  You may unsubscribe from receiving further such correspondence by following the included opt-out instructions.</p>
        <h4>Investigator Registration</h4>
        <p>You may apply to become an investigator on behalf of UBC by submitting an application available through the Site.  You will first need to review the Additional Terms associated with the application and then provide your consent.  After providing consent, we will collect Personal Information and other information necessary to determine your applicability for being an investigator with current and future studies.  We may then contact you regarding studies on which we believe that you may be a good candidate to participate.</p>
        <h4>How We Use Your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>We will not use or disclose your Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with applicable law, this Privacy Policy, the Additional Terms, or the SOP.  Examples of our uses and disclosures include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When requested and available, we will use your Personal Information to send informational newsletters to you.</li>
          <li>When you have applied to become an investigator, we will use your Personal Information and other information to determine whether you may be a good candidate for a study and to communicate with you regarding the study.</li>
          <li>We may share your Personal Information with selected service providers or consultants acting on our behalf.  Those third parties will be required to protect your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
          <li>We may disclose your Personal Information to relevant third parties such as site technicians, auditors, lawyers, or other professional advisors.</li>
          <li>We may send you promotional offers or marketing information that may be of interest to you.</li>
          <li>We may use third-party agents for purposes of marketing and transactional communications.</li>
          <li>We may send transactional and promotional communications to you via e-mail, facsimile, letter, text message, mobile phone, and similar mechanisms.  You may opt out of certain communication types by following the opt-out mechanism included with the communication or by contacting us via phone at (800) 349-0139 or e-mail at <a href="mailto:ubc_studies@ubc.com">ubc_studies@ubc.com</a>.</li>
          <li>Statements here and elsewhere on the Site concerning the treatment of your Personal Information may not apply with respect to information already in our possession.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In certain circumstances, we may be legally compelled to release your Personal Information in response to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation.</p>
        <h4>How You Can Correct/Update Your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>You can correct or update your Personal Information at any time using the following options:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h4>TRANSFER OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
        <p>All Personal Information and Non-Personal Information obtained through our Site is owned by us. Accordingly, if we are acquired, merge with another entity, or we divest one or more of our businesses, affiliates or subsidiary companies, the Site, and any Personal Information and Non-Personal Information obtained through it, may be transferred to an applicable entity for the purposes of continuation of services, in accordance with applicable law.</p>

You may also access our Site through a hyperlink embedded in a Linked Site.  We provide hyperlinks to the Linked Sites to enable you to conveniently access websites that may be of interest to you.  Please note that once you click on a hyperlink that transfers you from our Site to a Linked Site, you have left our Site, and this Privacy Policy will immediately cease to apply to any subsequent activity on the Linked Site.

Use of any Linked Site will be governed by the privacy policy, terms of use, and/or other policies (if any) on the Linked Site.  You may, at your option, participate in surveys or provide other information to our affiliates that control a Linked Site, and that information may be shared with us or with others subject to the privacy policy terms set forth on that Linked Site.  Certain Non-Personal Information that you choose to provide through a Linked Site (such as comments) that is subsequently provided to us by the Linked Site provider in connection with a service engagement may be identifiable to us as your personal information.</p>
